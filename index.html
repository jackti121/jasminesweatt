        <p class="heartfelt-message">i am praying that i got this done in time, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a huge pain.  Happy Valentine's Day, Jasmine!  I am so thankful for you, and I know I say it every single time we share a holiday together, but you mean so much to me I would do anything for you (including learning HTML hahahaha rizz)  I am disappointed that we cannot be together on the 14th, but I am looking forward to having dinner with you!  I've enjoyed these last 8, almost 9 months with you.  It has truly been pure bliss and I feel like the happiest man child in the world with you, my perfect, sweet sweet girl.  I loved testing this website and getting to see your beautiful face.  As tedious as this was, seeing you was calming and refreshing.  I love you so so so much, more the amount of dots on this page, the amount of bubbles, or the amount of pixels, and I always will.  Happy Valentines! ❤️ </p>
        <p class="heartfelt-message">Love, Jack </p>
